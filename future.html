    <h2>How do I "adult"?</h2>
    <p>This Section is going to cover a lot, but mostly about things related to Career Development. </p>  
    
    <h2>The Importance of a Resume</h2>
    <p>The first place to start is to create a resume for yourself. This will not only be important for finding your first job (if you don't already have one), but it will help showcase who you are to universities, potential future internships, and even to get scholarships. If you are in highschool or have graduated within the last two years, you should stick with things that are relevant to your high school years, such as clubs you were, sports, classes you've taken, etc. However, a piece of advice: if you're like me and have been out of highschool for a while, apparently no one cares that you were the captain of the debate club in high school, so leave those kinds of things out.</p>
      <p>Don't worry if you've never worked a job or don't have relevant career experience, I will link a website with some examples. The main thing is to list any skills you <i>do</i> have, like if you are proficient in Microsoft Word. </p>
    
    <h2>Job Searching</h2>
    <p>I will link a few job search engines to get you started, but some main ones include Indeed, LinkedIn, Zip Recruiter, and Monster</p>
    <p>When you finally are ready to start working, here are some things I wish someone had told me:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><b>Don't be a full-time student and be a full-time worker unless you have to. </b>I made the mistake of trying to work 40+ hours a week at Walmart while I was taking 15 credit hours my freshman year of college. Long story short, I ended up failing out because I was under so much stress. Mind you I was living at home so it wasn't like I had rent to pay (if this isn't your situation, I'd say ignore this part.) Trust me when I say it will not be worth it in the long run for a few extra dollars, your education is way more important.</li>
      <li><b>If you do have bills or just want some income coming in, opt for part-time.</b> I wish someone had told me that if I really felt I needed to work, or if I just wanted the work history, nothing says you can't put in 20 hours at your local bakery or something.  </li>
      <li><b>If you're looking for experience: Volunteer, Volunteer, VOLUNTEER.</b> I didn't learn this one until a little late, but one way to get some experience in the field you want is to volunteer for a company or do a job shadowing. Job shadowing is basically where you follow around a person in the field you want to be in, say tech, and learn about what they do and kind of be their personal assitant. This is a great way to gain experience for your resume without the full time commitment of a job. Plus you get to network.</li>
    
    <h2>My Tips on Interviews</h2>
      <p>I'd be lying if I said I don't still get nervous before an interview. These are some things I learned to help me feel more prepared and therefore more confident:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Show up early - you feel less rushed and it just shows professionalism</li>
      <li>Dress for the interview one notch above what the employees wear - if they wear business casual, dress business professional; if they dress casual, dress business casual</li>
      <li>Feel free to bring a notebook to the interview to write notes or write answers to questions you have</li>
      <li><i>Research the company ahead of time!</i> Take the notebook and write out things about the company's values from their website and compare them to yours</li>
      <li>Start off with an ice breaker if you can to lighten the room - tell a slight joke, compliment someone's hair, etc (this will help your nerves a bit)</li>
      <li>Always be honest about yourself and your skills</li>
    </ul>
