        <h4>Financial Literacy</h4>
        <p><i>noun</i></p>
        <p>The ability and competence to make smart decisions with money.</p>

    <h2>Budgeting and Tracking Your Spending</h2>
    <p>If you want advice from a <i>true</i> financial advisor, they would tell you to take a spreadsheet and calculate your monthly income and set XYZ percent to savings and ABC amount to your "transportation expenses" category... blah blah blah. What <b>I</b> am going to tell you is to track your spending.</p> 
      <p>Pick either a Google Sheet or a notebook and just start writing what you spend and how much, and break them into categories. Before you can begin thinking about a budget you need to know what you are spending money on the most, be it food, shopping, etc. You can't make a plan with your money if you don't know where it's going. </p>
    
    <h2>Save As Much As You Can!</h2>
    <p>If you don't currently pay any major bills, it would be VERY beneficial to put over half of whatever income you have into a savings account. The more money you can save before that point the more ahead you will be, trust me. If you are paying minor rent or any other bills, find out what your bills/important expenses are and subtract that from your monthly income. Take that amount and follow the rule above and put about 50% in a savings account. </p>
      <p>You can never save enough money for yourself, especially if you want to have some major purchases later on. If you feel you need it, you can have different savings accounts for different things, such as one for "moving out", one for college, and one for that new PlayStation you want. Once you subtract your bills AND your savings, use the rest to spend on whatever you want. These are good habits to start building without the restrictions of a budget... for now.</p>
    
    <h2>Before you move out</h2>
    <p>Having your own apartment definitely comes with a lot of freedom, but it also comes with responsibilities to maintain. Renting an apartment these days typically <i>starts</i> at $900 a month, not including utilities. Some things to consider before you decide to "leave the nest":</p>
    <ul>
      <li>If you don't pay bills currently and are currently working, I would advise you put a minimum of $500 a month into a savings account if you can. "Pay" yourself every month like it's a bill to build a habit. </li>
      <li>If you do currently pay rent at home (say $400 a month), take that amount and subtract it from $800 and put that amount into a "moving out fund" same as above.</li>
      <li>For every birthday, holiday, etc, try to ask for things that you would need for your future apartment, such as a kitchen set or a coffee maker (I did this and trust it helps)</li>
      <li>Take a look around at all of the things that you take advantage of in your home, such as furniture and appliances, and start thinking how those are things that someone in your home had to purchase (washing machines aren't free by the way)</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>Credit</h2>
    <p>I don't have much to say about credit except this: if you know you aren't disciplined enough, DON'T get a credit card or store card yet. It will just lead to a lot of problems and spending. Credit cards are designed to fuel instant gratification, and if you aren't careful you could find yourself in debt from unnecessary Target runs. If you are in college and have student loans, pay them off as soon as you can and this will boost your credit score (and you spend less money long term because of less interest) </p>
    <p>If you want a way to build your credit, take out a small store credit at a furniture store and make payments on that lamp for your mom. One thing that I used was a thing called Self Credit Builder Account. It's basically a "loan" that you pay every month and the bank reports it to the Credit Bureaus (three credit bank thingys), and after the end of your term they give you that money back. It's kinda like a savings account that builds your credit. </p>
