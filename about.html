    <h2>A Little About Me...</h2>

    <p>My name is Alexis Gray. My birthday is August 10, 2001. That makes me almost 22 at the time of writing this. I am creating this website because as the oldest sibling, a first-generation college student, and a second-generation Korean American, I never had someone to teach me a lot of basic skills growing up. It was hard for me to learn some basic skills that others may have learned from their parents or other older siblings. A lot of these skills I had to figure out along the way, and sometimes it was hard to stay motivated with some of these because I didn’t even know where to start looking online. While I am still trying to figure out things along the way, I am hoping to provide a centralized place for not just my siblings after me but hopefully others as well. </p>
    <p>I want my viewers to find a sense of relief knowing that someone knows and understands the struggle of just not knowing. I want them to take the advice that I am sharing and apply some of these skills for their next chapter in life. I hope that even if the user takes the information and decides it doesn’t fit their situation, that what I am sharing on my website will provide a foundation for their new life.  </p>
    <p>My dedication is going to go to my younger sisters, but once I publish it, I hope it will reach other teens/young adults like you who need a “game plan” just to get started.</p>
