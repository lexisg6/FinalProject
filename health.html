    <h2>Your Physical Health</h2>
    <h3>What you put in your body matters</h3>
    <p>I know no one wants to sit and count calories all day (and that actually has some other proven effects on your mental health) but what you put in your body matters. I know probably prior to this point, you could eat all of the snack cakes and Big Macs you wanted and been fine, but not having a proper diet will have some horrible long-term effects on your health. </p>  
    <p>Two major things I want you to be mindful of: 1) you are still allowed to enjoy the foods you love but in proper moderation. If you really love cookies, its okay to eat a few once or twice a week, but don't make it an everyday habit. 2) Try to incorperate at least one fruit and vegitable into your meals. No the lettuce on your cheeseburger does not count. </p>
    <p>I need to take my own advice a bit when I say this, but try to get a little physical activity every day. Even if you aren't going to a gym every day, try to a least go for a stroll every morning or do some streches before bed. Your body will thank you.</p>
    
    <h2>Your Mental Health</h2>
    <p>If you take nothing else I say to you, take this: yes be kind to others always, but <em>remember to be kind to yourself!</em> Remember that as long as you are doing your best, even if it's not up to the standards of anyone else, you are doing great. Find things that make you happy and do them whenever you are stress or sad or angry. It may sound silly, but for me it's listening to music and coloring in my coloring book. Whatever it is for you, it doesn't have to make sense to anyone else.</p>
    <p>You may have people in your life that may shun you or think less of you for being your true self, but listen when I tell you that those people will NEVER be worth it. True friends will love and accept all aspects of you, it just takes time to meet good people. Always be true to yourself and you'll find them.</p>
    
    <h2>Reaching Out</h2>
    <p>Contrary to common belief, there is no way you will always be able to do everything on your own. Yes, you should strive for independence, but it's important to know when to ask for help. If you think you need therapy, go to therapy. If you need to call a friend to ask for advice, call them. Know that there are people in your life that care about you and your wellbeing. If you can remove things from your life that have no positive purpose, omit them quickly.</p>
